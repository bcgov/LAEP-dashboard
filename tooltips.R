  If a particular industry is growing or declining in a local area, an automatic question is whether it is \"natural\" in the sense that it is also growing or declining in other areas. Shift/share analysis attempts to answer this question by breaking down the change in employment by industry group into three components:

    - The Provincial Effect (PE), or whether employment is increasing in the province overall.
    - The Industry Effect (IE), or whether the sector is expanding or declining in the province generally, at a rate faster than overall job growth.
    - The Local Effect (LE), or the growth or decline that can only be attributed to the specifics conditions of the sector in the local area.

  The Local Effect is most interesting for analysis purposes. It implies that the local area is somehow over- or under-performing with respect to employment in that sector.
